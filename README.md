# Algorithms
Typing some algorithms taught on school or from MIT course
# To try out the code:
1- Compile it using g++
2- Create a script of unsorted/sorted data (int)
3- compile the file by typing g++ sort.cpp -o ev.exe
4- execute the file by typing ./ev.exe i path-of-your-file path-to-the-sorted-data path-to-a-performance-file
Note that the order of algorithms is as follows
0 insertion sort
1 selection sort
2 merge sort
3 quick sort
4 hybird sort (created by the author)
5 heap sort
