# Algorithms

Applying algorithms taught at school or by MIT courses.

## Getting Started

To compile any file just use g++ compiler and type the file's name, then exexute it as follows..

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
g++ compiler
```

## Running the tests

When sorting an integers of arays, place your unsorted list next to the (sort.cpp) file and -after compiling- execute the file in that manner
```
./a.out #numberOfDesiredAlgorithm #YourFile'sPath #The-pathToSortedArray #PathToShowPerformance
```
 #numberOfDesiredAlgorithm:
 
 0 insertion sort
 
 1 selection sort
 
 2 merge sort
 
 3 quick sort
 
 4 hybird sort (created by the author)
 
 5 heap sort
